# CS506-Lab4

In this lab, we will use the BBC News dataset to perform Topic Modeling using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). The BBC dataset contains articles from three news categories (topics), and we will apply LSA to uncover hidden topics within these articles. Weâ€™ll preprocess the dataset, apply SVD, and interpret the results by labeling the discovered topics.
